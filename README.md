# Simple Todo App

This is the seventh project in the Software Engineer Bootcamp offered by TripleTen. Project Seven pertains to refactoring an already existing Todo application, especially with the use of the this keyword.

## Functionality

It is a simple Todo application which features a button that, when clicked, pops up a modal with a form and two input fields: one for a required todo name; the other for an optional date. Once submitted, the little todo is appended to the initial list of todos and features a unchecked checkbox and delete button - both being functional.
